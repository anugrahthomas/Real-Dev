Stream: sequence of data in chunks, not all at once.

Types of Streams:
1. Readable Stream
2. Writable Stream
3. Dupex Stream: Can read and write (tcp/socket)
4. Transform Stream: special duplex stream that modifies data while passing it through
  - Compression
  - Encryption
  - Uppercasing text
eg:
const { Transform } = require("stream");
const upperCase = new Transform({
  transform(chunk, encoding, callback) {
    this.push(chunk.toString().toUpperCase());
    callback();
  }
});


⚙️ How Streams Work Internally
Streams use:
- Buffering
- Events
- Backpressure

📡 Flowing vs Paused Mode
- Readable streams operate in 2 modes:
🔹 Flowing Mode
- Automatically emits "data" events.
- stream.on("data", chunk => {})
🔹 Paused Mode
- You manually call .read()

🚦 Backpressure (Very Important)
Backpressure happens when:
- Writable stream cannot handle data as fast as readable stream produces it.
Node handles this using:
- readable.pipe(writable)

.pipe() automatically:
- Manages flow
- Prevents memory overload
- Handles backpressure


🆚 Streams vs Buffers
Buffers                   Streams
Entire data in memory	    Chunked data
Heavy memory usage	      Efficient
Blocking risk	            Non-blocking


🧠 Mental Model
Think of streams like:
🚰 A water pipe
• Readable = faucet
• Writable = drain
• Pipe = pipe connection
• Backpressure = pressure control valve

pipeline:
const { pipeline } = require("stream/promises");
await pipeline(
  fs.createReadStream("input.txt"),
  fs.createWriteStream("output.txt")
);

Streams are used in:
- HTTP requests
- HTTP responses
- File uploads
- File downloads
- Video streaming
- Proxy servers
- Compression
- Database exports

☀️ Streams + HTTP Internals
req.on("data", chunk => {})
This is how:
- Multer works
- S3 upload works
- Video streaming works


⚠️ Memory Comparison
Without stream:
- 1GB file → 1GB RAM usage.
With stream:
- Maybe 64KB at a time.


🧠 Architect-Level Thinking
- Where are streams used in real systems?
- Nginx proxying requests
- CDN streaming video
- Netflix adaptive bitrate
- API gateways
- Reverse proxies
- Microservice communication
